      <em>IT Deparpment: <strong>Project Manager</strong></em><br>
      <em>Los Angeles, CA 91342</em><br>
      <p>I am a project manager at AASS. I enjoy working in a cross-funtional team to create a process or
        product to help people work better. <br>
        Thanks to my teammates and managers, I learn to listen attentively and be patient.<br>
        My boss encourages me to travel towards the fear. Through taking on projects that
        are out of my comfort-zone, I continuously challenge
        my self-learning ability, in return, the journey keeps me humble.<br>
